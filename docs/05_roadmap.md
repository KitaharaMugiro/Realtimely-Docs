# Road Maps

Realtimely leaves a lot of challenges to make it usable in Production, and we will focus on solving them in the short term.
After I can solve that part,
* Implemented an option that allows the backend to be built in the AWS cloud owned by the user
* Alternatively, function development that can be used for more general purposes I plan to go.

Regarding this, I will consider which one to prioritize according to the demand.
